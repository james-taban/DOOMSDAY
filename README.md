The game challenges users to start and stop a countdown timer. The twist is that they must stop the timer just before it reaches zero. The game becomes increasingly difficult as the countdown duration shortens, testing both precision and reflexes.

## Gameplay

1. The user selects or is assigned a random countdown duration (e.g., 1 second, 2 seconds, etc.).
2. The user starts the countdown timer by clicking a button.
3. The goal is to stop the timer before it runs out of time.
4. The closer you are to stopping the timer before it hits zero, the better your score.
